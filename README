GwtAdvancedLogin
by Ashton Thomas (www.acrinta.com)

This Google Web Toolkit (GWT) application is an example of how to create a separate Login Module 
which then funnels to one or many other modules that contain the main applicaiton login.

Demo:

You can use this type of setup to take full control over you login page while not including it
in your main module.
